This dashboard provides an analysis of marketing performance, highlighting audience engagement and key KPIs for Q2.

It aims to support data-driven decisions to improve marketing effectiveness.

The dataset used for this analysis was generated by AI to ensure no recognizable user data was involved. I performed data cleaning and transformation, then visualised the data using Looker to identify key insights that could inform strategic decisions.
